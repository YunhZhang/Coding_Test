# Coding_Test
Please run fitting.py to check the code.  
The code uses pands, scipy.optimize and matplotlib.pyplot to fit a curve in the form of:  
$$E(V) = a + bV^{-2/3} + cV^{-4/3} + dV^{-6/3}$$ 
using the data from eos.csv  

In the end the fitted parameters: a,b,c,d are printed after running the code, so is the plot of the fitted curve vs. data points.
